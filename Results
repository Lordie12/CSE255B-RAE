4-fold cross validation:

Alpha = 0.3, Lambda = 0.01, 56 iterations
20 Dimensional meaning-vector
Convergence condition = difference of norms of theta vectors 
Training set accuracy: 95.43% (classification at root node only, softmesax)
Test set accuracy: 67.85% (classification at root node only, softmax)

Modifications:
Leaf nodes included for classification error
Normalized derivative, tanh(a)/ ||tanh(a)|| used

Bag of words model - no tree structure, only leaf nodes
Alpha = 0 (no reconstruction), lambda, 20 dimensional meaning-vector
Convergence condition = difference of norms of theta vectors
Training set accuracy: 94.12%
Test set accuracy: 66.09%
